<p>The <b>Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust</b> (affectionately known as QEST) is a Art and Craft Education trust created to sustain traditional British craftsmanship. It is a British Institution committed to helping support craftspeople of all ages and from all backgrounds, at a critical stage in their careers. The trust was established in 1990 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Royal Warrant Holders Association and the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. In 2016, QEST welcomed Her Majesty The Queen Elizabeth II as Patron in her 90th birthday year.</p>
