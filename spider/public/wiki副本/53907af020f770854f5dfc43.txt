<p><b>Artificial life</b> (often abbreviated <b>ALife</b> or <b>A-Life</b>) is a field of study wherein researchers examine systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. The discipline was named by Christopher Langton, an American computer scientist, in 1986. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: <i>soft</i>, from software; <i>hard</i>, from hardware; and <i>wet</i>, from biochemistry. Artificial life researchers study traditional biology by trying to recreate aspects of biological phenomena.</p>
