<p><i><b>Synthese</b></i> is a scholarly periodical edited by Ot&#xE1;vio Bueno, Wiebe van der Hoek, and Gila Sher specializing in papers in epistemology, methodology, and philosophy of science. Published articles include specific treatment of methodological issues in science such as induction, probability, causation, statistics, symbolic logic, linguistics and ethics. The name <i>Synthese</i> (from the Dutch for <i>synthesis</i>) finds its origin in the intentions of its founding editors: making explicit the supposed internal coherence between the different, highly specialised scientific disciplines.</p>
