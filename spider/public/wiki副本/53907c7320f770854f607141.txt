<p>The <i><b>International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems</b></i> was founded in 1993 and is published bimonthly by World Scientific. It covers research on methodologies for the management of uncertainty. Topics include expositions on methods such as Bayesian and probabilistic methods, nonstandard logic, as well as applications, such as in image processing, conflict resolution, and databases. The journal does not publish papers on pure fuzzy mathematics, such as fuzzy topology or fuzzy algebra.</p>
