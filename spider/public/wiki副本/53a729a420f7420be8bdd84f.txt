<p>The <b>International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality</b> (<b>ISMAR</b>) is the leading international academic conference in the field of Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. The symposium is organized and supported by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE VGTC [1]. The first ISMAR conference was held in 2002 in Darmstadt, Germany. The creation of the conference emerged from the fusion of two former academic events dedicated to this research field: the International Symposium on Augmented Reality (ISAR) and the International Symposium on Mixed Reality (ISMR) [2].</p>
