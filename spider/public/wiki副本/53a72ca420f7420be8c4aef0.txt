<p><b>Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems</b> (<b>CHES</b>) is a workshop for cryptography research, focusing on the implementation of cryptographic algorithm. The two general areas treated are the efficient and the secure implementation of algorithms. Related topics such as random number generators, physical unclonable function or special-purpose cryptanalytical machines are also commonly covered at the workshop. CHES is sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research. It was first held in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1999 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). It was founded by &#xC7;etin Kaya Ko&#xE7; and Christof Paar. CHES 2000 was also held at WPI; after that, the conference has been held at various locations worldwide, including in chronological order Paris, San Francisco, Cologne, Boston, Edinburgh, Yokohama, Vienna, Washington, D.C., Lausanne, Santa Barbara, Nara, Leuven, and again Santa Barbara. In the last few years, CHES had between 300-400 participants, making it one of the largest events in the academic cryptography community.</p>
