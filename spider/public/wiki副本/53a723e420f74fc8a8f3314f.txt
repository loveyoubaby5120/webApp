<p>Artificial intelligence has been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, remote sensing, scientific discovery and toys. However, due to the AI effect, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: &quot;A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it&apos;s not labeled AI anymore,&quot; Nick Bostrom reports. &quot;Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.&quot; In the late 90s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes. </p>
