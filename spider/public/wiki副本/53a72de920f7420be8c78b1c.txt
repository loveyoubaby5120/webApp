<p><b>Business process management</b> (<b>BPM</b>) is a field in operations management that focuses on improving corporate performance by managing and optimizing a company&apos;s business processes. It can therefore be described as a &quot;process optimization process.&quot; It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization.</p>
