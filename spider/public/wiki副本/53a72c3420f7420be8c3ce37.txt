<p>The <b>Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference</b> (GECCO) is one of the largest conferences in the area of Evolutionary computation. GECCO is held every year since 1999, it presents the latest findings in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics of interest include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, memetic algorithms, hyper-heuristics, evolutionary robotics, real-world applications, evolutionary machine learning, evolvable hardware, artificial life, amongst others.</p>
