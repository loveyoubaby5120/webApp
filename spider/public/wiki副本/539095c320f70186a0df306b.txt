<p><b>Information technology</b> (<b>IT</b>) is the application of computers and internet to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level &quot;contain some degree of commonality in that they are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically mediated communications.&quot; Business/IT was one level of the ICT hierarchy.</p>
