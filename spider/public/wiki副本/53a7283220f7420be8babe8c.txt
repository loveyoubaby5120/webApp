<p>A <b>Petri net</b> (also known as a <b>place/transition net</b> or <b>P/T net</b>) is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph, in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows). Some sources state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri&#x2014;at the age of 13&#x2014;for the purpose of describing chemical processes.</p>
