<p><b>Long Reach Ethernet</b> (<b>LRE</b>) was a proprietary networking protocol marketed by Cisco Systems, intended to support multi-megabit (5 to 15 Mbit/s) performance over telephone-grade unshielded twisted pair wiring over distances up to 5,000 feet (1.5&#xA0;km). Supporting such distance ranges, LRE is technically classified a Metropolitan area network (MAN) technology. Technically the protocol was similar to very-high-bitrate digital subscriber line (VDSL).</p>
