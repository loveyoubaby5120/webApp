<p>LREC, the <i>International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation</i> is a biennial conference organised by the European Language Resources Association with the support of institutions and organisations involved in Natural language processing. The series of LREC conferences was launched in Granada in 1998. Since then, LREC has become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&amp;D directions and emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and organisational ones.</p>
