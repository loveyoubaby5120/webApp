<p><b>Interaction</b> is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. <i>Interaction</i> has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction.</p>
