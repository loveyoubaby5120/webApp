<p><b>SIGCSE</b> is the Association for Computing Machinery&apos;s Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education, which provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy. It is also the name of one of the three annual events organized by SIGCSE. This event, a.k.a. <b>ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education</b>, is held annually in February or March in the USA. SIGCSE also sponsors an annual conference in or around Europe, named ITiCSE (Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education), usually in late June, and an annual research workshop named ICER (International Computing Education Research), at varied locations, usually in August.</p>
