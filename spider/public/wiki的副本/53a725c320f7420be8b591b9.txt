<p>The <b>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)</b> is an annual conference for Information Systems and Information Technology academics and professionals sponsored by the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Along with ICIS, HICSS is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious international conferences for IS/IT in the world. The conference, which now draws over 1,000 participants every year, provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of peer-reviewed information systems research papers. Papers selected for presentation appear in the <i>HICSS Proceedings</i> published by IEEE, which have grown to add nearly 6,000 additional pages of refereed material annually. In addition, the Symposia, Workshops, and Tutorials held on the first day are a program component that specifically contributes to the quality of the conference.</p>
