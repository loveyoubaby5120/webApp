<p>In machine learning and cognitive science, an <b>artificial neural network</b> (<b>ANN</b>) is a network inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) which are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs that are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are typically specified using three things:</p>
