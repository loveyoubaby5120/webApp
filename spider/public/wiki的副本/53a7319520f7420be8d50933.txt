<p><b>Artificial intelligence</b> (<b>AI</b>) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal &quot;intelligent&quot; machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is applied when a machine mimics &quot;cognitive&quot; functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;problem solving&quot;. As machines become increasingly capable, facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data.</p>
