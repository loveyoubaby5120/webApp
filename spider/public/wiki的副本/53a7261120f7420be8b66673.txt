<p><b>The European Anti-Capitalist Left</b> (EACL) is an informal network for left-wing and anti-capitalist parties in Europe. EACL met for the first time in Lisbon in March 2000, with representation from the Scottish Socialist Party, the Portuguese Left Bloc, the Danish Red-Green Alliance, the French LCR, and the Turkish &#xD6;DP. Since its initial meeting, the EACL meets every six months. The EACL took part in the Europe against Austerity Conference in 2011 and 2012.</p>
