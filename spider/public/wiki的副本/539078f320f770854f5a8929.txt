<p><b>Operations research</b>, or <b>operational research</b> in British usage, is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. Further, the term &apos;operational analysis&apos; is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military, as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance. In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British defence capability acquisition decision-making.</p>
