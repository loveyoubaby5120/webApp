<p><b>Information visualization</b> or <b>information visualisation</b> is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from scientific visualization: &quot;it&#x2019;s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it&#x2019;s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given&quot;.</p>
