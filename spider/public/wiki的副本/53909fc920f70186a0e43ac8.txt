<p><b>Systems engineering</b> is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles. At its core systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body knowledge. Issues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, <i>coordination</i> of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, organizational studies, and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.</p>
