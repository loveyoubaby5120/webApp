<p><i><b>ACM Transactions on Algorithms</b></i> (<i>TALG</i>) is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering the field of algorithms. It was established in 2005 and is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. The editor-in-chief is Aravind Srinivasan (University of Maryland). The journal was created when the editorial board of the <i>Journal of Algorithms</i> resigned out of protest to the pricing policies of the publisher, Elsevier. Apart from regular submissions, the journal also invites selected papers from the <i>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)</i>.</p>
