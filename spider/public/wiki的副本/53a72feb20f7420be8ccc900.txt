<p>The <b>International Committee for Prostitutes&#x2019; Rights (ICPR)</b> emerged from the prostitutes&apos; rights movement starting in the mid-1970s. The ICPR adopted the World Charter for Prostitutes&apos; Rights in 1985 in response to feminist arguments that all prostitution is forced prostitution. The Charter calls for the decriminalisation of &quot;all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision&quot;. The Charter also states that prostitutes should be guaranteed &quot;all human rights and civil liberties, including the freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, and motherhood and the right to unemployment insurance, health insurance and housing.&quot; The Charter established a human rights based approach which has subsequently been further elaborated by the prostitutes&apos; rights movement.</p>
