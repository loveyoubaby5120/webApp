<p>Initiated in 1968, by a small group of distinguished circuit theorists, <i><b>IEEE</b> ISCAS</i> has grown into a premier annual conference reflecting the diversity, richness, and significance of the circuits and systems fields, as well as the growing technological applications and knowledge economy that is based on circuits and systems fundamentals. It is the largest yearly conference under IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, which attracts thousands of hundreds of researchers throughout the world. ISCAS is frequently considered an &quot;academic&quot; conference, whose participants are predominantly researchers in universities. Unlike its sister conferences such as ISSCC, DAC and ITC, it gets less number of industry attendance and industry papers.</p>
