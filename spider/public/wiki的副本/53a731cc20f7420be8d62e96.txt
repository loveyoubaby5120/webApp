<p>A <b>natural history museum</b> or <b>museum of natural history</b> is a scientific institution with natural history collections that include current and historical records of animals, plants, fungi, ecosystems, geology, paleontology, climatology, and more. The primary role of a natural history museum is to provide the scientific community with current and historical specimens for their research, which is to improve our understanding of the natural world. Some museums have public exhibits to share the beauty and wonder of the natural world with the public; these are referred to as &apos;public museums&apos;. Some museums feature non-natural history collections in addition to their primary collections, such as ones related to history, art, and science.</p>
