<p>The <i><b>European Journal of Combinatorics</b></i> (usually abbreviated as <i>European J. Combin.</i>), is a peer-reviewed scientific journal for combinatorics. It is an international, bimonthly journal of pure mathematics, specializing in theories arising from combinatorial problems. The journal is primarily open to papers dealing with mathematical structures within combinatorics and/or establishing direct links between combinatorics and other branches of mathematics and the theories of computing. The journal includes full-length research papers, short notes, and research problems on important topics. This journal has been founded by Michel Deza, Michel Las Vergnas and Pierre Rosenstiehl. The current editors-in-chief are Patrice Ossona de Mendez and Pierre Rosenstiehl.</p>
