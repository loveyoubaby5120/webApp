<p>The <b>Positron-Electron Tandem Ring Accelerator</b> (<b>PETRA</b>) is one of the particle accelerators at DESY in Hamburg, Germany. From 1978 to 1986 it was used to study electron&#x2013;positron collisions. It was here that the TASSO collaboration found the first direct evidence for gluons in three jet events. The modification called PETRA-II is a source of high-energy synchrotron radiation and also a pre-accelerator for the HERA. Started in 2007, an upgrade has been converting it to PETRA-III, which is a high intensity source for synchrotron radiation.</p>
