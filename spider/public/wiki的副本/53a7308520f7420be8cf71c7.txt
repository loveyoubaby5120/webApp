<p>The <b>International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</b> (<b>IJCAI</b>) is a gathering of artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners. It is organized by the IJCAI, Inc., and has been held biennially in odd-numbered years since 1969. Starting in 2016, IJCAI conferences will be held annually. IJCAI is a highly selective conference. For instance, only 17% of the papers submitted to the conference were accepted in 2011, and in previous years never more than 26%. This makes it a more selective publication than many AI journals.</p>
